"My Runs!" is an "app" made in HTML, CSS, and JS that's composed of a leaderboard documenting my jogging time or bike runs, and having it ranked and serving as a time-attack like in Burnout. It has 4 sections in v1.0, and these are currently:
Home
Morning
Night
Publish



Home
Home consists every run from "Going out" and "Going home." 

Morning
This section presents on you from your home to your desired location. Since I have a lot of routes going to school, I have since named it "Going out."

Night
Once again, this section presents on you going from your specific location to your home.

Publish
This section makes you fill out 5 questions in order to add your run.

Route - Where you started
Location - Which route you took
When - When it happened
Minutes - How long in minutes (can extend to hours)
Seconds - How long in seconds

Once it's filled out, you can add your run to your leaderboard and see how well you did compared to your other runs!
